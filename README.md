The MoviesDatabase API allows developers to search for movies, retrieve detailed information, and access user reviews. It supports various endpoints to fetch data based on genre, popularity, and user ratings.

## Version
This is another second-level heading.

The current version of the API is `v1.2.0`.

## Available Endpoints
Below is a list of available endpoints provided by the API:

- `/movies/popular` - Retrieve a list of popular movies.
- `/movies/{id}` - Get details about a specific movie.
- `/genres` - Fetch a list of available genres.

## Request and Response Format
Requests are made in the following format:

```json
GET /movies/{id}

Headers:
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

## Authentication
To use the MoviesDatabase API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to authenticate your requests:

1. Register for an API key on the MoviesDatabase platform.
2. Include the API key in the `Authorization` header for all requests.

### Example Header


Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Inception",
  "release_date": "2010-07-16",
  "rating": 8.8
}

## Error Handling
The MoviesDatabase API provides structured error responses to help identify and resolve issues with requests. Common errors include:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was malformed or missing required parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The API key is invalid or missing.
- **403 Forbidden**: The API key does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded; wait before making more requests.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "status_code": 401,
  "status_message": "Invalid API key: You must be granted a valid key.",
  "success": false
}

## Usage Limits
The MoviesDatabase API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage among all users. These limits vary based on the subscription tier:

- **Free Tier**: Allows up to 100 requests per hour.
- **Pro Tier**: Allows up to 10,000 requests per hour.

### Monitoring Usage
- Most API platforms provide a usage dashboard. Use it to monitor your request counts.
- Consider implementing logging in your application to track API requests and responses.

### What Happens When You Exceed Limits?
- If the rate limit is exceeded, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
- The response headers often include information about when you can resume making requests.

```json
{
  "status_code": 429,
  "status_message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds.",
  "success": false
}
